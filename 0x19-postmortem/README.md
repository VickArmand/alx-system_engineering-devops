<h1>Postmortem</h1>
<p>A <b>postmortem (or post-mortem)</b> is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.</p><br>
<p>Postmortems typically involve blame-free analysis and discussion soon after an incident or event has taken place. An artifact is produced that includes a detailed description of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incident, along with a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar incident from occurring again in the future. An analysis of how your incident response process itself worked during the incident should also be included in the discussion. The value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a culture of continuous improvement. This way, teams are better prepared when another incident inevitably occurs with mission- or business-critical systems.</p><br>
<ul>After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:
<li>To provide the rest of the companyâ€™s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.</li>
<li>And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.</li>
</ul>
