# application servers are designed with a master/workers infrastructure. The master is in charge of: Receiving requests, Managing workers (starting, stopping), Distributing requests to workers
# Workers are the actual ones processing the query by generation dynamic content by processing the application code.
# To update an application without downtime, the master will proceed with a progressive rollout of the update. It will gracefully shut down some workers ( meaning that it will tell workers to finish processing the request they are working on, but will not send them new requests, once the worker is done, itâ€™s will be shutdown) and start new ones with the new application code or configuration, then move on to the other old workers until it has renewed the whole pool.
# Bash script to reload Gunicorn in a graceful way.
